Made using VSCode, Took help from vasrious sites.

Thanks to redhat-raptor for helping!

Use my code for whatever you like (It's a work in proggress.)

If you dont know how knock-knock jokes work; they go like this:

Knock Knock!

Whose there?

Test!

Test who?

Test joke! (I couldn't think of anything atm lol)

-----

Note: when the program asks you the "knock knock" part, make sure to reply with "Whose there" and when it says the <joke> part make sure to say <joke> who or it will not work.
